If you have a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) website or resource link to add to the Bitcoin Cash Resources page on BitcoinProtocol.org, you can request it here by [submitting a new issue](https://github.com/davidshares/bitcoinprotocol.org/issues). You don't need to format it, just submit your URL and explain why you think it should be added. 

In the title make sure to say this is for the Resources page. Accepted websites will be added to the page periodically. If there are issues, you'll be notified here on Github.
